    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Not only is this apple and onion smothered beef brisket easy and delicious, 
        it's also very fast (for a brisket recipe)! 
        Cooking it low and slow often results in dried-out meat, so instead we dial up the 
        temperature slightly and bake it in about half the time to ensure it's both tender and moist.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prep the meat:</strong>
            <p>
                Season both sides of the brisket generously with salt, pepper, and cayenne. For best results, 
                place brisket over an aluminum foil "rack" set over a plate and refrigerate, uncovered, 8 to 12 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
            </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the Braising Liquid:</strong> 
            <p>
                Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. 
                Add onion and salt. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir in garlic, rosemary, and apple juice. 
                Increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced by about half, about 3 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Move Ingredients to Baking Dish:</strong> 
            <p>
                Transfer half of the apple-onion mixture into a baking dish. 
                Place brisket fat-side up on top; cover with remaining apple-onion mixture. 
                Cover baking dish tightly with foil.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake the Meat:</strong> 
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. 
                Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) and bake until fork-tender, 
                about 2 hours 15 minutes. Check for doneness after 2 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create the Gravy:</strong>
            <p>
                Transfer brisket to a plate and tent with foil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pour the onions and braising liquid into a large measuring cup or bowl. 
                Skim some fat off the top. Puree with a stick blender to create a gravy.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong>
            <p>
                Slice brisket across the grain and serve with the gravy.
            </p>
