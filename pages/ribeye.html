    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this 
        recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

            <p>
                Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. 
                Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. 
                Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. 
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
            </p>
